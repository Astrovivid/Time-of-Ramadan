<h1>A Message From Author</h1>

<p>Hi guys! I'm back with a new project. As you know that Ramadan will begin on 22 March 2023, many peoples are excited for the day and 
they are counting days for the holy month. Also I'm so excited for the month! That's why this website got a chance to live for us. This web-
site will be showing us that how long time is left for start of Ramadan. I developed this website through watching some videos and using 
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, also I added some codes from my old repos. The background is downloaded from Pinterest.
I will create another page and I will attach it with this repo as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Message To Beginners</h2>
